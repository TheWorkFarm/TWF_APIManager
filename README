This Project is an example of setting up a Singleton to use as a way to manage API requests.

- edit the APIManagerSettings.plist to add baseURL, apiKey and apiSecret
- each API request is it's own class allowing for greater flexibility in acting on response data
- uses notifications to pass messages and data around

- #import ApiManager.h
- create notification observer for response handling
- [ApiManager sharedInstance] nameOfAPICallSetInApiManager];
